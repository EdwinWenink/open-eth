## Jeremy Bentham's Hedonistic Act-Utilitarianism


## W. D. Ross' prima facie ethical duties

* *fidelity*: you should honor promises and live up to agreements that you’ve voluntarily made,
* *reparation*: you should make amends for wrongs you’ve done,
* *gratitude*: you should return favors,
* *justice*: you should treat people as they deserve to be treated, in light of their past behavior and rights they might have,
* *beneficence*: you should act so as to bring about the most amount of good,
* *nonmaleficence*: you should act so as to cause the least harm, and
* *self-improvement*: you should develop your talents and abilities to the fullest.

## John Rawls' Reflective equilibrium

Reflective equilibrium is essentially a three-step process whereby one

1. identifies a group of considered judgments about justice (intuitions about justice that strike one as relatively secure, such as that slavery and religious persecution are unjust),
2. attempts to explain and justify these considered judgments by discovering what (relatively more abstract) principles of justice can serve as their foundation, and
3. addresses any lack of fit between the principles one has arrived at and considered judgments about justice other than the group from which one started.


## Michael Anderson's GenEth

Given two actions $A₁$ and $A₂$ determine the operation $preferable(A₁, A₂)$.

An action is a vector in $ℤ^f$.

Use resolution to determine $preferable$ from the cases.
